# Federated-Imitation-Racing

## Description
**Federated-Imitation-Racing** is a project that explores **supervised federated learning** applied to autonomous driving in the context of **Mario Kart Wii**.  
The goal is to train models across multiple clients without sharing raw gameplay data, enabling privacy-preserving imitation learning of racing behavior.
Playersâ€™ actions (steering, acceleration, and item usage) are recorded as labeled datasets. Federated learning techniques then allow multiple models to collaboratively improve by sharing gradients or model weights instead of raw gameplay data.

## Features
- **Federated Learning:** Train models across multiple clients without centralizing sensitive gameplay data.
- **Imitation Learning:** Learn to drive by mimicking players.
- **Privacy-Preserving:** Only model are shared; raw data remain local.
- **Simulation-Compatible:** Works with Mario Kart Wii gameplay data recorded from Dolphin emulator or other sources.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **Docker Desktop**  
   - Required to run the server and client containers.  
   - Download and install: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

2. **Dolphin Emulator (with Python scripting support)**  
   - Required for recording gameplay and running automated scripts.  
   - Clone: [https://github.com/Felk/dolphin](https://github.com/Felk/dolphin)  
   - This is a branch with Python Scripting support.
   - Place the Dolphin Installation in `dolphin/`.
   - Place any custom Dolphin scripts under `client/dolphin/Scripts/`.

### Training models
1. **Record your game data**
    - Start Dolphin.
    - Load Mario Kart Wii.
    - Run logging.py
2. **Run the compose**
    - ```bash
      docker compose up
    - This will train and send a model to the central server.

## TODO
Update README.md.
